const guint8 *
gdk_pixbuf_read_pixels (const GdkPixbuf *pixbuf);

Returns a read-only pointer to the raw pixel data; must not be modified. This function allows skipping the implicit copy that must be made if gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels() is called on a read-only pixbuf.


GdkPixbuf *
gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file (const char *filename,
                          GError **error);

Creates a new pixbuf by loading an image from a file. The file format is detected automatically. If NULL is returned, then error will be set. Possible errors are in the GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR and G_FILE_ERROR domains.

Parameters

filename

Name of file to load, in the GLib file name encoding

error


Return location for an error

Returns

A newly-created pixbuf with a reference count of 1, or NULL if any of several error conditions occurred: the file could not be opened, there was no loader for the file's format, there was not enough memory to allocate the image buffer, or the image file contained invalid data.
